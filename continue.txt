add threading system
dont forget to make functions that deconstruct the objects to garbage collect

also only allow functions to be public in classes (change to private)

extensions should be able to know what file type is opened so it can apply it's magic

make a template queue for all of the automated functions such as drawRect, drawTrig, etc.

also try to separate the text into different buffers per line (new line every time enter is pressed)

font loader function to update font size and font family

think of a system that allows for easy character grouping and ungrouping 
(cluster system, where characters are deconstructed based on what line is highlighted, then converted back into single textures (still allows for word/character searching and positional data))
